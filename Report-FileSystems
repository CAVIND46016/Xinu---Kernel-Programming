File creation has been implemented in the Xinu root directory (/root) using functions like
fs_open, fs_close, fs_create, fs_seek and fs_read.

The code checks whether user entered file exists in the root directory or not. If yes, it throws an error saying file already created , else
it creates the file with random values as its contents.
